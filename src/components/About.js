      <p>
        Hey there, I'm Rytham Sharma, a 3rd-year B.Tech student with a Computer Science
        major from India. I'm deeply passionate about web development and have
        honed my skills in creating dynamic and interactive websites. My toolbox
        includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I use to craft seamless user
        interfaces that offer exceptional experiences. I've also dived into
        back-end development using Flask, a powerful Python web framework. This
        allows me to build robust and feature-rich web applications that combine
        functionality with elegance. My knowledge extends to front-end libraries
        and frameworks like React, enabling me to construct modern, responsive,
        and visually appealing web solutions. Whether it's designing from
        scratch or enhancing existing projects, my web development prowess lets
        me turn digital concepts into captivating online experiences.

      <p>
        The "iNotebook" project was a collaborative endeavor undertaken during
        my computer science studies, showcasing the power of the MERN stack.
        With a focus on creating a seamless digital platform for note
        management, we harnessed the capabilities of MongoDB, Express.js, React,
        and Node.js. This comprehensive stack allowed us to cover the entire
        development cycle, from front-end user interface to back-end data
        storage. Incorporating modern front-end technologies like React, we
        designed an intuitive, responsive, and engaging user interface. The
        application's dynamic features allowed users to create, edit,
        categorize, and organize their notes efficiently. On the back end, we
        utilized Node.js with Express.js to create a robust API, handling user
        authentication and seamless communication between the client and the
        MongoDB database. The "iNotebook" project seamlessly merged our skills
        in MERN stack development, enabling users to securely manage their notes
        while enjoying a smooth and user-friendly experience. The project served
        as a testament to our proficiency in full-stack development, ensuring
        that users could easily capture, organize, and access their thoughts and
        ideas at their convenience.
